# Swift 4

* New KVO and KVP syntax, we need examples
* Let's make PubNub sdk be kvo compliant
* Still no stable ABI
* Still some changes to syntax and functionality
* All old projects need to be audited
* New JSONDecoder seems useful
	* In order to use, we need to return raw data
	* Should consider subscriber callbacks that return raw data and that return batches of messages
